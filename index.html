        <p>My love for learning new skills led me down the road to web design and development. Starting with my first website in 2002, I have been constantly building personal websites and improving them to meet my needs. All of my coding knowledge
          has
          been self-taught, with the help of the all-knowing Google. Everyday I see something new that I want to incorporate into my websites and strive to learn how to do it. I feel that coding is a stress-reliver for me.</p>
